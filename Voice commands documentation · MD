## How to Add Custom Commands

Want to add more commands? Here's the template:

```python
# 1. Create function
def your_command_name():
    """Description of what command does"""
    result = do_something()
    speak(f"Result: {result}")

# 2. Add to main() function
elif "[keyword]" in query:
    your_command_name()

# 3. Test it
# Say the keyword into microphone
```

**Example: Adding a "time to dinner" command**

```python
def time_to_dinner():
    """Tell how long until dinner time"""
    now = datetime.datetime.now()
    dinner_time = now.replace(hour=18, minute=0)
    
    if now > dinner_time:
        dinner_time = dinner_time + datetime.timedelta(days=1)
    
    time_left = dinner_time - now
    hours = time_left.seconds // 3600
    minutes = (time_left.seconds % 3600) // 60
    
    speak(f"{hours} hours and {minutes} minutes until dinner")

# In main:
elif "dinner" in query:
    time_to_dinner()
```

## Tips for Voice Recognition

### Best Practices:
1. **Speak clearly** - Enunciate words properly
2. **Avoid background noise** - Quiet environment works best
3. **Use keywords** - Include main command keyword in phrase
4. **Natural pace** - Don't rush or slow down excessively
5. **Short sentences** - Easier to recognize

### Voice Command Tips:
```
✅ GOOD:
- "What time is it?"
- "Tell me a joke"
- "Open camera"
- "Search for Python"

❌ AVOID:
- "Um, what is the time thing"
- "Hey Nova, um, joke please?"
- "SEARCH FOR PYTHON PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE WIKIPEDIA"
```
